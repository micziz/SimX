Welcome to the world of SimulationeXtreme! Work, buy, sell and do much more all in your command line.

## What is SimX?

SimX, witch stands for SimulationeXtreme (i know, not really extreme but it's my game and i make the rules...) is a real-ish simulator of life. It's currently in very early stages of development, but you would help out a ton if you visited the project, and gave me a help with contributions...

## Installation

See [install.md](doc/install.md)

## Faq
### WHY?

I was bored!!!!

### Who is SimX developed by?

By me! And also contributors. You can check the list at the end!

### Can i contribute?

Of course! Just check contributing.md, complete the checklist and then feel free to open a PR!

## Compatibility.

The app was developed in python 3.10.2, the latest at this time. 

**Compatible**:

- Should be compatible with all version above 3.0, tested with python 3.8.9 and upwards, best used with python 3.10.2!

**Incompatible**:

- Python 1.0
- Python 2.0

### Why?

Python 3 breaks compatibility from python 2 a lot. Hers'e an [article](https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html).

As for python 1.0, it's just too plain old, and basically nothing works with this. Plus i cannot test it, as my computer is too new!
